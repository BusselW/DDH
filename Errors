# Portal-Design3-Map
The UI is rendered in avery very small frame. 


# ProblemDashboard-design1.aspx
This is probably the most like what my original request hoped to get as a result. 

# https://som.org.om.local/sites/MulderT/CustomPW/DDH/CPW/DDH2/ProblemDashboard-Design2.aspx
This is clean but arguably cannot be viewed fully because the data is not loading 

#https://som.org.om.local/sites/MulderT/CustomPW/DDH/CPW/DDH2/ProblemDashboard-Design4.aspx
The 'opgelost' items are not expandable? And I cannot select the gemeente. att elast, doesn't look like it.

# https://som.org.om.local/sites/MulderT/CustomPW/DDH/CPW/DDH2/ProblemDashboard-Design5.aspx
This is more like a statisctics dashboard, not a 'press gemeente and see problems + more data' type of thing?

# https://som.org.om.local/sites/MulderT/CustomPW/DDH/CPW/DDH2/ProblemDashboard-Design6.aspx
Do not need a mobile example. Make this full screen, maybe it's good.

# https://som.org.om.local/sites/MulderT/CustomPW/DDH/CPW/DDH2/ProblemDashboard-Design7.aspx
I love this. Maybe keep it as a statistics dashboard... but translate EVERYTHING into Dutch and replace everything with SVG icons...

# https://som.org.om.local/sites/MulderT/CustomPW/DDH/CPW/DDH2/ProblemDashboard-Design8.aspx
Efficient and boring. Makke the 'Show 1 problems' into a button so it's easier to expand into problemen.

# https://som.org.om.local/sites/MulderT/CustomPW/DDH/CPW/DDH2/ProblemDashboard-Design9.aspx
Hate this. Redesign this into a different concept entirely.

# https://som.org.om.local/sites/MulderT/CustomPW/DDH/CPW/DDH2/ProblemDashboard-Design10.aspx
Same as previous

# https://som.org.om.local/sites/MulderT/CustomPW/DDH/CPW/DDH2/ProblemDashboard-Design11.aspx
Same as previous

# https://som.org.om.local/sites/MulderT/CustomPW/DDH/CPW/DDH2/ProblemDashboard-Design12.aspx
Same as previous

# https://som.org.om.local/sites/MulderT/CustomPW/DDH/CPW/DDH2/ProblemDashboard-Design13.aspx
Has potential but needs to be un-boring'd.
